- **277K monthly listeners on Spotify** - puts you in the top 1% of all artists globally
- **$550K+ earned independently** - proves business acumen and market validation
- **Official remixes for RÜFÜS DU SOL, ZHU, Wiz Khalifa** - A-list industry connections

### The Gap You Need to Bridge
You have the credentials of a $10K+ educator but the positioning of a $500 course creator. Your streaming success and industry connections put you in the top 1% of producers, yet your business model doesn't reflect this elite status.

## Your Transformation Strategy

### Phase 1: Consolidate Your Authority (Immediate - Month 1)

#### Create a Single Premium Hub
- **withlovefromtaches.com** should become your premium education headquarters
- Retire scattered course sites and redirect everything here

#### Reframe Your Messaging Hierarchy
1. **Lead with elite status** - "Top 1% Global Artist (277K Monthly Listeners)"
2. **Stream validation** - "From the producer behind 71M+ streams"
3. **Industry connections** - "Remixer for RÜFÜS DU SOL, ZHU, Wiz Khalifa"
4. **Business success** - "$550K+ earned as independent artist"
5. **Unique approach** - "Where technical mastery meets spiritual practice"

- Community access
- Position as "entry level" to your teaching

#### Retire Low-Value Offerings
