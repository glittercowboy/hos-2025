    <!-- #3 The Problem Section (1 column - 8 blocks wide) -->
    <section class="problem">
        <div class="container width-8">
            <p class="drop-cap">
                Most aspiring artists focus solely on acquiring technical knowhow, unconsciously treating music as an intellectual exercise rather than a soulful art form. They binge-watch tutorials, stock-piling knowledge as they seek the perfect piece of information before they can truly get started. They can't help but buy whatever shiny new piece of gear an ad promises to give them a fleeting feeling of inspiration. When they're not being "consumers", they are being mere "producers" - robotic technicians who copy others and follow trends but struggle to create original and meaningful music themselves.

            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">Instead of <i>empowered artists</i>,<br>they become <i>disempowered</i> "content creators"</h4>
            <p>
                You see, while technical skills are necessary to produce quality music, they alone don't create art that has the power to truly move people. Empowered artists - the kind capable of deeply affecting listeners and creating real change in the world - know that their power does not come from filling the mind with techniques, but from using one's heart to amplify their passion and emotions. Great art is not forcibly made. It appears - as if by magic - when you allow your heart to guide your creative process.
            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">This is the <u>only</u> way that <i>technique</i> can be used<br> to create something extraordinary.</h4>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- #4 A Different Approach To Creation (1 column - 8 blocks wide) -->
    <section class="desires-struggles, section-light">
        <div class="container width-8">
            <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">A DIFFERENT APPROACH<br> TO CREATION</h3>
            <p class="drop-cap" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                Imagine approaching your DAW without the weight of expectation or self-judgment. No more anxiety about whether your music will "measure up." No more paralysis trying to perfectly recreate sounds from your reference tracks.
            </p>
            <h5 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                Instead, you enter a conversation with music itself.
            </h5>
            <p style="line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            What would it feel like to finish tracks regularly not through discipline or willpower, but because you're so engaged in the creative process that completion becomes natural?<br><br>
            The most valuable asset you possess isn't your technical knowledge or plugin collection – it's your unique perspective. No one else has lived your exact life, felt your specific emotions, or experienced sound through your particular sensory system. When you create from this authentic place:   
            </p>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>Technical decisions become clearer because they serve your expression</li>
                <li>You're no longer lost in endless options because you have a clear artistic direction</li>
                <li>Your music develops a signature quality that listeners can recognize instantly</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                This shift creates profound creative freedom. The endless overthinking that paralyzes so many producers – "Is this kick drum right?" "Does this arrangement follow the rules?" – gives way to more meaningful questions about emotional impact and authentic expression.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h5 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                The producer you could be has learned to transform singular experiences into music that could only have come from you.
            </h5>
            <p style="line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 40px;">   
                Perhaps the most valuable transformation isn't just in the music you create but in your relationship with creativity itself. You develop a sustainable creative practice that doesn't depend on sporadic inspiration or endless technical acquisition. Your approach is built on the foundation of emotional authenticity and collaborative listening, remaining relevant regardless of how production technology evolves.<br><br>
                The result is creative longevity. Rather than burning brightly for a short period before succumbing to burnout – the fate of so many technically skilled but philosophically adrift producers – you develop a practice that continues to nourish both you and your listeners over the long term.
            </p>
            <h5 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;">
                Your relationship with music becomes regenerative rather than extractive.

I really harmonise with TÂCHES' unique way of connecting with music in an organic, ritualistic kind of way. It was great receiving feedback from TÂCHES but I also really loved getting input from the other students. Being part of a course together and learning as a community is just amazing. It really helped me level up and I'm much more able to enjoy making music and have become much less afraid to share it with others."
