            I've spent years observing what separates artists who thrive from
            those who remain stuck. The difference isn't talent or technical
            knowledge - it's in how they approach creation and their relationship
            with their art. I've lived on both sides of this divide, and I want
            to share what I've learned.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px">MY OBSERVATIONS</h2>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          Over my 13-year journey in music, I've watched countless talented
          producers (including myself) get stuck in the same pattern. We focus
          entirely on acquiring technical knowledge, unconsciously treating
          music as an intellectual exercise rather than the soulful art form it
          truly is. We binge-watch tutorials, stockpile information, searching
          for that one perfect technique that will finally unlock our
          creativity. We chase whatever new plugin promises a fleeting feeling
          of inspiration.<br /><br />
          When we're not being consumers, we become mere "producers" - technical
          operators who copy others and follow trends but struggle to create
          music that genuinely reflects who we are. I know this pattern
          intimately because I lived in this space for years, feeling
          increasingly disconnected from the joy that drew me to music in the
          first place.
        </p>
        <h4 style="line-height: 1.5">
          I realized that instead of creating as an
          <i>empowered artist</i>, I had become a <i>disempowered</i> "content
          creator"
        </h4>
        <p>
          I've learned that while technical skills are necessary to produce
          quality music, they alone don't create art that truly moves people.
          The power to affect listeners doesn't come from filling your mind with
          techniques, but from allowing your heart to guide your creative
          process. I've found that music appears - almost like magic - when you stop
          forcing it and instead serve as a channel for something greater than
          yourself.
        </p>
        <h4 style="line-height: 1.5">
          I believe this is the <u>only</u> way that <i>technique</i><br />can
          be used to create something extraordinary.

        <p class="drop-cap fade-in" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I want you to sit down at your DAW and feel a sense of possibility
          instead of dread. I want you to make decisions confidently rather than
          second-guessing every move. I want to free you from that nagging voice
          wondering if your music is "good enough" - because you'll know it is. I
          want to break you out of endless tweaking that leads nowhere, and
          instead help you experience the profound satisfaction of consistently
          finishing tracks that excite you.<br /><br />
          I've guided hundreds of producers through this transformation, and
          I've seen how it changes not just their music, but their entire
          relationship with creativity.

            YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS
          </h5>
          <p class="fade-in">
            You'll finish tracks consistently because you'll be engaged in
            making decisions that matter, not drowning in options. Your
            technical choices will become clearer because they'll serve your
            vision rather than replacing it. I've watched the overthinking that
            once paralyzed me (and probably you) give way to confident
            action - and it's one of the most liberating feelings I know.

            YOUR UNIQUE VOICE
          </h5>
          <p class="fade-in">
            You'll stop chasing others' sounds and start developing something
            genuinely yours. Your music will develop a recognizable quality that
            listeners connect with immediately. I've experienced this
            myself - when you create from your authentic center, you make music
            only you could make, becoming impossible to replicate or replace.
            This is where genuine connection happens.

            YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MUSIC

          <p class="fade-in">
            You'll build a sustainable practice that doesn't depend on random
            bursts of inspiration. Your approach will remain relevant regardless
            of which plugins or DAWs come next. I've found that this way of
            creating music energizes rather than depletes you, allowing you to
            produce consistently for years, not just months - while actually
            enjoying the process again.

          This isn't about small improvements to your current process. It's
          about fundamentally transforming how you approach every aspect of
          music creation - and finally becoming the artist you've always known you
          could be.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 1.8;">
          I know what you might be thinking - "Is my music ready for this level of investment?" The truth is, your music doesn't become "ready" through endless tweaking in isolation. It grows through completion, feedback, and guided exploration of your authentic voice.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 40px; line-height: 1.8;">
          You don't need to be at some specific technical level to benefit - I've seen producers at all stages experience profound shifts when they focus on their relationship with music rather than just accumulating more techniques.

          A JOURNEY FROM TECHNICAL PRODUCER TO EMPOWERED ARTIST
        </h6>

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2">
             I know the path you're on because I've walked it myself. For years, I
          was that overthinking producer - starting dozens of tracks I couldn't
          finish, chasing sounds I heard in other artists' music, and feeling
          perpetually unfulfilled despite pouring endless hours into
          production.<br /><br />
          Everything changed when I realized music wasn't something to conquer
          but a relationship to nurture. This shift transformed not just how I
          made music but my entire career, leading to everything I've
          accomplished since - over 71 million streams, performances at venues and
          festivals worldwide, and collaborations with artists I once only
          dreamed of working with.<br /><br />
          Yet what mattered most wasn't the external success, but the internal
          transformation. I found myself creating music that genuinely moved me
          again, finishing tracks with confidence rather than endless
          second-guessing, and developing a sound that was unmistakably mine.

          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
            <strong>•</strong> We balance technical skills with intuitive development - these aren't separate approaches but two sides of the same coin
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
            <strong>•</strong> You'll learn to collaborate with music as a living force rather than trying to control it
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
            <strong>•</strong> You'll grow in community, not isolation - because transformation happens through connection and feedback
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
            <strong>•</strong> The focus is on creating music that moves YOU first, rather than chasing others' approval
          </p>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2">
          In this 12-week journey, I'll guide you through this same
          transformation. We'll develop a personal creative philosophy that
          grounds your decisions in intuition rather than endless comparison.
          You'll evolve from a technical producer into an
          artist who creates music that moves people - starting with yourself.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2">
          This isn't just about teaching you production techniques - though you
          will become technically proficient. It's about cultivating a
          mindset that supports a lifetime of authentic artistic expression. Whether you want to build a career in
          music or simply create work that genuinely satisfies you, this journey
          will transform how you approach every aspect of your creative process.

        Howdy. I'm TÂCHES. Like many of you, I started my journey as someone who loved music but struggled to fully express what I heard in my head. I spent years in that familiar cycle - starting countless tracks that remained unfinished, chasing sounds I heard in other people's music, and feeling a growing disconnect between my technical knowledge and my creative satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        Everything changed when I shifted my approach - moving from seeing music as something to conquer to viewing it as a relationship to nurture. This fundamental shift not only transformed my creative process but led to everything I've accomplished since.

I've created official remixes for artists like RÜFÜS DU SOL, ZHU, and Wiz Khalifa, and performed at iconic venues from XOYO London to Burning Man.

      </div>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
        I created Heart of Sound because I kept meeting talented producers who were stuck in the same patterns I once was - technically skilled but creatively unfulfilled. I saw how the standard approach to music education focuses almost exclusively on techniques while neglecting the deeper relationship with creativity itself.
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        This course isn't just information I've gathered - it's the exact process I wish I'd discovered years earlier. Every workshop, exercise, and conversation is designed to help you avoid the detours and dead ends that once held me back, so you can get to the essence of your creative voice more directly than I did.

      <div style="position: relative; padding-left: 28px;">
        

        <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
          What sets my teaching apart isn't just what I know, but what I've lived. I've been on both sides of the divide - struggling as a technical producer who couldn't finish tracks and thriving as an artist who creates from a place of intuition and authentic expression.
        </p>
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
          I believe music production isn't just a technical skill but a spiritual practice - an art form that has the power to effect positive change in the world. My approach seamlessly blends technical mastery with intuitive development, guiding you to find your unique voice while giving you the practical skills to express it fully.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          When we work together, you're not just gaining knowledge - you're gaining a guide who has walked the path from frustration to fulfillment and can show you the way through your own unique journey.

          <p>
            Guatemala-based visionary MOSE transcends traditional electronic
            production by infusing his music with ceremonial intention and
            spiritual depth. Through his pioneering "cacao dance" ceremonies and
            soul-stirring productions, he demonstrates how music becomes a
            vessel for healing and connection rather than mere entertainment.
            Students will learn from his unique approach to creating music as a
            sacred conversation - perfectly embodying the Heart of Sound
            philosophy that music should be approached as a divine force we
            collaborate with rather than simply technical content we create.

          <p>
            Montreal's Kora exemplifies Heart of Sound's vision of the empowered
            artist - having built a distinctive sonic identity that attracts
            devoted followers while maintaining complete creative control
            through his acclaimed Saisons label. His masterful storytelling
            through melodic house transcends genre boundaries, proving that
            authenticity resonates more powerfully than trend-chasing. Students
            will discover how to balance emotional depth with technical
            precision, creating music that both moves dancers physically and
            touches listeners spiritually - the essence of making music that truly
            matters.

          <h3>YEMANJO</h3>
          <p>
            Multi-instrumentalist YEMANJO demonstrates the transformative power
            of approaching music as cultural conversation rather than
            appropriation. His acclaimed album "La Misma Fuente" weaves global
            traditions into a borderless sonic tapestry that honors indigenous
            wisdom while innovating fearlessly. Students will learn his approach
            to integrating diverse cultural elements with modern production
            techniques, creating music that transcends barriers while
            maintaining authentic emotional resonance - embodying the course's
            philosophy of music as a unified, healing force rather than a
            technical exercise.

                I've learned that trying to sound like everyone else is the fastest path to creative burnout. I'll guide you to uncover and develop your unique perspective, so your music stands out because it could only have come from you.

I'll help you build the habits and mindset that transform ideas into completed tracks, ensuring your creative work actually reaches listeners. This steady output is what build real momentum in your artistic journey.

This mental foundation is often the difference between artists who thrive and those who remain stuck.

This authentic expression is what creates lasting connection through your art.

            I've been on both sides of this decision. I've spent thousands on plugins that gathered dust while my creative blocks remained. I've invested countless hours in tutorials that left me with technical knowledge but no finished music. And I've also experienced the profound shift that comes from investing in transformative guidance that addresses the root causes rather than the symptoms.

            The producers who've joined me consistently report that the transformation in their creative process continues to yield returns years later. Many have shared that the confidence and clarity they developed have led to opportunities, artistic breakthroughs, and creative satisfaction they couldn't have imagined before. The real value isn't measured in the 12 weeks we spend together, but in the lifetime of authentic artistic expression that follows.

          QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE
        </h2>

        <h5 style="text-align: left ; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">I'm worried my music isn't "ready" for this level of investment. Should I wait until I improve more?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I hear this concern from almost every producer I work with, and it's exactly the mindset shift we address in the course. Your music doesn't become "ready" through endless tweaking in isolation - it grows through completion, feedback, and active guidance. If you understand the basics of your DAW and have been producing for at least 6 months, you're ready. This journey isn't about achieving some arbitrary technical standard first; it's about transforming how you approach creation itself, regardless of your current level.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">How is this different from all the tutorials and courses I already have access to?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I created Heart of Sound precisely because I saw what was missing in production education. Most resources focus solely on technical knowledge - more plugins, more techniques, more shortcuts - without addressing how to integrate those skills with your unique voice. I spent years watching talented producers (including myself) struggle despite amassing technical knowledge because we lacked the mindset and approach to use those skills effectively.<br><br>This journey bridges that gap by addressing both the technical and the intuitive, the practical and the philosophical. You're not just watching videos in isolation - you're receiving direct guidance from me and support from a community that understands your challenges. We're focused on transformation, not just information.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">What equipment do I need to participate fully?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">You'll need Ableton Live, a reliable computer, headphones or monitor speakers, and a journal for reflection. A MIDI controller is helpful but not essential. I've intentionally designed this journey to focus on your approach and mindset rather than specific gear or plugins. Some of my most successful students have had surprisingly minimal setups - because creating meaningful music ultimately comes from clarity of purpose, not complexity of equipment.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">What if I miss a session? Will I fall behind?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I've designed this journey with real life in mind. All sessions are recorded and permanently available, so you can revisit them whenever works for you. My teaching assistant and I also provide detailed session summaries highlighting key concepts, so you can quickly catch up on essential points. The community aspect means fellow producers often share insights you might miss, and I'm available to address questions from any session during our office hours.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">I'm concerned about the time commitment. How much time will I really need?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">You should plan for 5-10 hours weekly, including 4 hours of live calls plus 1-6 hours for assignments and practice. This range allows you to determine your engagement level based on your current life circumstances. I've found this to be the sweet spot that allows for meaningful progress without overwhelming your schedule. The course is designed to integrate with your life, not consume it - and many students report that the structured approach actually helps them use their music time more efficiently than before.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">I worry I won't be able to keep up with others in the course. What if I'm behind everyone else?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This journey isn't a competition - it's a personal transformation supported by a community. Each producer moves at their own pace, and I welcome and celebrate that diversity. Some of my most successful students initially felt they were "behind," only to discover their unique perspective was exactly what made their music special. I'm there to meet you where you are, not where you think you "should" be compared to others. Often, the questions you're afraid to ask are the ones several others are thinking too.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">I've tried other courses before and still feel stuck. Why would this be different?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Most courses focus on specific techniques without addressing the fundamental relationship you have with music creation itself. I know the frustration of collecting knowledge that doesn't translate to finished music you love - it's exactly what drove me to develop this approach.<br><br>What makes Heart of Sound different is that we address the root causes of creative stagnation: overthinking, comparison, perfectionism, and disconnection from your authentic voice. The combination of philosophical shifts, practical techniques, ongoing feedback, and community support creates a comprehensive environment for transformation that isolated learning simply can't provide.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">This is a significant investment. How do I know it will be worth it for me?</h5>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This is a question I deeply respect. The investment in Heart of Sound isn't just financial - it's also your time, energy, and creative trust. What I can share is that this approach has transformed not just my own career but the creative lives of hundreds of producers across all levels.<br><br>The value extends far beyond the 12 weeks we spend together. Producers who've joined me report that the transformation in their creative process continues to yield returns years later - in finished music, creative confidence, and the joy of making art that truly reflects who they are. Unlike gear that becomes outdated or techniques that change with technology, the mindset and approach you develop here will serve your creative life for years to come.</p>

    We all reach moments where we must choose our path forward
</h3>

<p style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 2; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 40px;">
    You can continue collecting more technical knowledge, starting tracks that remain unfinished, and feeling that disconnect between what you imagine and what you create. Or you can transform your relationship with music itself.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    I remember standing exactly where you are now - technically capable but creatively unsatisfied. What I discovered on the other side of that threshold was not just better music, but a renewed sense of purpose and joy in creation.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 40px;">
    I created Heart of Sound because I believe the music within you deserves to be heard. Not just by others, but first and foremost by you. The world doesn't need more producers who sound like everyone else - it needs your unique voice, your particular way of hearing and interpreting the world.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    If what I've shared resonates with you, then perhaps we're meant to take this journey together. I would be truly honored to guide you through the same transformation that changed everything for me.
