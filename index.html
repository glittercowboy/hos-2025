        <div class="container width-8">
            <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">THE STRUGGLE</h2>
            <p class="drop-cap">
                Most aspiring artists focus solely on acquiring technical knowhow, unconsciously treating music as an intellectual exercise rather than a soulful art form. They binge-watch tutorials, stock-piling knowledge as they seek the perfect piece of information before they can truly get started. They can't help but buy whatever shiny new piece of gear an ad promises to give them a fleeting feeling of inspiration. When they're not being "consumers", they are being mere "producers" - robotic technicians who copy others and follow trends but struggle to create original and meaningful music themselves.

            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">Instead of <i>empowered artists</i>,<br>they become <i>disempowered</i> "content creators"</h4>
            <p>
                You see, while technical skills are necessary to produce quality music, they alone don't create art that has the power to truly move people. Empowered artists - the kind capable of deeply affecting listeners and creating real change in the world - know that their power does not come from filling the mind with techniques, but from using one's heart to amplify their passion and emotions. Great art is not forcibly made. It appears - as if by magic - when you allow your heart to guide your creative process.
            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">This is the <u>only</u> way that <i>technique</i> can be used<br> to create something extraordinary.</h4>

            <p class="drop-cap fade-in" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                Imagine approaching your DAW without second-guessing every decision. No more anxiety about whether your music is 'good enough.' No more endless tweaking that leads nowhere. No more starting tracks you never finish. Instead, picture yourself in a creative flow state where each choice feels meaningful and purposeful, where you're building something that genuinely excites you.

                <p class="fade-in">
                    You finish tracks consistently because you're engaged in making decisions that matter, not drowning in options. Technical choices become clearer because they serve your vision rather than replacing it. The overthinking that paralyzes most producers gives way to confident action.

                <p class="fade-in">
                    You stop chasing other artists' sounds and start developing something genuinely yours. Your music develops a recognizable quality that listeners connect with immediately. You create tracks that only you could make—becoming impossible to replicate or replace.

                <p class="fade-in">
                    You build a sustainable practice that doesn't depend on random bursts of inspiration. Your approach remains relevant regardless of which plugins or DAWs come next. You create music that energizes you rather than depletes you, allowing you to produce consistently for years, not just months.

            <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2;">In this 12-week journey, I'll show you how to collaborate with music as a living force rather than trying to control it. You'll transform from a technical producer into an empowered artist who creates music that genuinely moves people.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2;">This course lives in the space between technical mastery and emotional intelligence. While we'll deep-dive into production techniques, our focus remains on developing a personal creative philosophy—one that grounds your decisions in intuition rather than endless comparison or second-guessing.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2;">It's not just about teaching you production techniques - though you will become a technical master - it's about helping you cultivate a mindset that will support a lifetime of authentic, connected and meaningful artistic expression.</p>
            
            <h5 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 40px; line-height: 1.5;">

                Howdy. I'm TÂCHES - a world-renowned artist and creativity coach. When not working on my own music, I teach producers like yourself how to break free from the shackles of overthinking and become empowered artists capable of authentically expressing yourself and consistently sharing your art with the world.<br><br>
                Over the last 13 years, I've captured the hearts of millions globally with over 116 tracks released on my critically acclaimed label GLITTER COWBOY, as well as many other respected labels like Anjunadeep, Get Physical, Kitsuné and Kindisch.<br><br>
                I've been asked to create official remixes for globally renowned artists, including RÜFÜS DU SOL, ZHU, and Wiz Khalifa. As a performer, I've graced iconic clubs and festivals worldwide, including XOYO (London), Do Not Sit On The Furniture (Miami), Output (New York), Burning Man, Splash House and Bestival. My work has been featured in top publications like Vogue, Billboard, and Mixmag. Additionally, I was a featured artist on British Airways' In-flight Entertainment, with a 2-hour mix of solely original music streaming on flights globally.<br><br>
                I believe that music production need not be just a technical skill but a spiritual practice—an art form that has the power to effect positive change in the world. What sets me apart from other teachers is my holistic approach to education, which seamlessly blends the development of technical mastery with deep intuition, guiding my students to find their unique voices as artists and use them to make a lasting impact on the world.

His passion for music shines through as a conduit for feeling and an invitation for movement… I don't just leave his presence inspired to make music, I find myself more interested in the tender intricacies of the human experience, knowing everything I feel will become an ingredient in a delicious sonic soup."

                    "This course gave me real clarity around how to approach drums, mixing and mastering and starting new projects without overthinking every small decision. TÂCHES is hilarious and his ability to relate to his students with funny anecdotes made each lesson a joy. Before this course, I found excuses not to make music because "I wasn't inspired." Now, I feel empowered to create inspiration for myself. I am so thankful for every minute spent with TÂCHES"

                    "What a brilliant course! It really helped me have less judgement around my music and taught me to unify myself more with the process. I really harmonise with TÂCHES' unique way of connecting with music in an organic, ritualistic kind of way. It was great receiving feedback from TÂCHES but I also really loved getting input from the other students. Being part of a course together and learning as a community is just amazing. It really helped me level up and I'm much more able to enjoy making music and have become much less afraid to share it with others."
