                    <p>
                        ✘ Repeatedly start projects and leave them unfinished. Because of this they have little to show for the (often huge amount of) time and energy they put into their music.<br><br>
                        ✘ Rely on copying other artists and following trends because they don't have a sound of their own. Because of this they struggle to truly connect with people through their music.<br><br>
                        ✘ Operate from a state of scattered and lethargic existential panic about how to pursue their dreams. Because of this they have no direction and are often disappointed and disenfranchised.<br><br>
                        ✘ Are intimidated by social media and marketing themselves. They do little to let people know they exist. Because of this they struggle to grow their fanbases.<br><br>
                        ✘ Just want to get a break. Because of this, they are desperate and attract experiences that rob them of their creative energy, leaving them questioning whether they should quit.<br><br>
                        ✘ Operate as lone wolves and are starved of healthy community to inspire and support them. Because of this they feel lonely on their creative journeys.<br><br>
                        ✘ View music as a technical exercise, focusing on what buttons to press rather than why they're pressing them. Because of this, their music lacks emotional depth despite technical proficiency.

                        ✔ Truly communicate who they are through their music. Thus, they develop a deeply connected following around, and adoration for, who they truly are as creators.<br><br>
                        ✔ Are disciplined and diligent in the pursuit of their dreams. They know where they want to go and have a plan for how to get there. Thus, they are the writers of their own stories and take full responsibility for their lives.<br><br>
                        ✔ Know who they are and are unafraid to share themselves authentically. Thus, they attract fans who connect with them on the deepest level.<br><br>
                        ✔ Create the circumstances necessary to capitalise on opportunity. Thus, they get to pick the projects that enliven them and help them do what they love to do on a larger scale.<br><br>
                        ✔ Have a dedicated support network of likeminded artists and creators. Thus, they feel secure and know that they are not alone as they move forward.<br><br>
                        ✔ Approach production as a conversation with music rather than trying to conquer it. Thus, they create music that feels alive and emotionally resonant in ways that technical perfection alone cannot achieve.

    <!-- #3 The Problem Section (1 column - 8 blocks wide) -->
    <section class="problem">
        <div class="container width-8">
            <p class="drop-cap">
                Most aspiring artists focus solely on acquiring technical knowhow, unconsciously treating music as an intellectual exercise rather than a soulful art form.
                They binge-watch tutorials, stock-piling knowledge as they seek the perfect piece of information before they can truly get started. They can't help but buy whatever shiny new piece of gear an ad promises to give them a fleeting feeling of inspiration.  
                When they're not being "consumers", they are being mere "producers"; robotic technicians who copy others and follow trends but struggle to create original and meaningful music themselves.
            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">Instead of empowered artists, they become disempowered "content creators".</h4>
            <p>
                You see, while some amount of technical skills are necessary to produce quality music, they alone don't create art that has the power to truly move people. 
                Empowered artists - the kind capable of deeply affecting listeners and creating real change in the world - know that their power does not come from filling the mind with techniques, but from using one's heart to amplify their passion and emotions. 
                Great art is not forcibly made. It appears - as if by magic - when you allow your heart to guide your creative process.
            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">This is the only way technique can be used to create something extraordinary.</h4>

TÂCHES is hilarious and his ability to relate to his students with funny anecdotes made each lesson a joy. Before this course, I found excuses not to make music because "I wasn't inspired." Now, I feel empowered to create inspiration for myself. I am so thankful for every minute spent with TÂCHES"

I really harmonise with TÂCHES' unique way of connecting with music in an organic, ritualistic kind of way. It was great receiving feedback from TÂCHES but I also really loved getting input from the other students. Being part of a course together and learning as a community is just amazing. It really helped me level up and I'm much more able to enjoy making music and have become much less afraid to share it with others."

            <p>This course is designed for producers who are committed to transformation. The application process helps ensure we're the right fit for each other and that you'll benefit from this approach.</p>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h4 style="text-align: center;">STEP 1: SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION</h4>
                <p>
                    A formal application is required for consideration. Share your musical background, current challenges, and what you hope to gain from this experience. This helps me understand where you're coming from and if my approach aligns with your goals.<br><br>
                    Your application should include links to your current work, regardless of how "finished" or "professional" it sounds. I'm not looking for technical perfection but for genuine expression and commitment to growth.<br><br>
                    All applications are reviewed personally by TÂCHES – not by an algorithm or assistant.

                <p>
                    Following your application submission, I'll take up to one week to thoroughly review your materials. This isn't about judging technical proficiency but understanding your creative voice and whether my approach will genuinely serve your development.<br><br>
                    I carefully consider each application to ensure the cohort consists of producers who will benefit from and contribute to the collaborative environment.<br><br>
                    Selected applicants will be invited to the next step – a personal conversation.

                <p>
                    This 30-minute conversation isn't an interview but a chance for us to connect and ensure mutual alignment. We'll discuss your relationship with music, your creative challenges, and what you hope to discover through this journey.<br><br>
                    I want to make sure my approach genuinely resonates with you and that you understand what this course offers – and importantly, what it doesn't. This conversation helps ensure we're both invested in your success.<br><br>
                    This is as much about you determining if this course is right for you as it is about me determining if you're right for the course.
