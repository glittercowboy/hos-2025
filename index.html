    <section class="problem">
        <div class="container width-8">
            <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px;">MY OBSERVATIONS</h2>
            <p class="drop-cap">
                Over the last 13 years, I've watched countless talented musicians get stuck in the same pattern. They focus entirely on acquiring technical knowledge, unconsciously treating music as an intellectual exercise rather than the soulful art form it truly is. They binge-watch tutorials, stockpiling information as they search for that one perfect piece of knowledge that will finally unlock their creativity. They can't help but chase whatever shiny new piece of gear promises them a fleeting feeling of inspiration.<br><br>
                When they're not being consumers, they become mere "producers"—technical operators who copy others and follow trends but struggle to create music that genuinely reflects who they are. I know this pattern intimately because I've been there myself.
            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">Instead of <i>empowered artists</i>,<br>they become <i>disempowered</i> "content creators"</h4>
            <p>
                You see, while technical skills are necessary to produce quality music, they alone don't create art that has the power to truly move people. Empowered artists - the kind capable of deeply affecting listeners and creating real change in the world - know that their power does not come from filling the mind with techniques, but from using one's heart to amplify their passion and emotions. Great art is not forcibly made. It appears - as if by magic - when you allow your heart to guide your creative process.
            </p>
            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">This is the <u>only</u> way that <i>technique</i> can be used<br> to create something extraordinary.</h4>

            <p class="drop-cap fade-in" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                I want you to approach your DAW without second-guessing every decision. I want to free you from the anxiety about whether your music is 'good enough.' I want to help you break free from endless tweaking that leads nowhere, and instead experience the profound satisfaction of consistently finishing tracks that genuinely excite you.<br><br>
                I've guided <i>hundreds of producers</i> through this transformation, and I've seen how it changes not just their music, but their entire relationship with creativity.

                <p class="fade-in">
                    You finish tracks consistently because you're engaged in making decisions that matter, not drowning in options. Technical choices become clearer because they serve your vision rather than replacing it. The overthinking that paralyzes most producers gives way to confident action.

                <p class="fade-in">
                    You stop chasing other artists' sounds and start developing something genuinely yours. Your music develops a recognizable quality that listeners connect with immediately. You create tracks that only you could make—becoming impossible to replicate or replace.

                    You build a sustainable practice that doesn't depend on random bursts of inspiration. Your approach remains relevant regardless of which plugins or DAWs come next. You create music that energizes you rather than depletes you, allowing you to produce consistently for years, not just months.

            <h6 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom: 30px;">A TRANSFORMATIVE JOURNEY FOR MUSIC PRODUCERS</h6>
            
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2;">My own path wasn't always smooth. For years, I struggled as that overthinking producer—starting dozens of tracks I couldn't finish, chasing sounds I heard in other artists' music, and feeling perpetually unfulfilled despite pouring endless hours into production.<br><br>
            Everything changed when I realized music wasn't something to conquer but a relationship to nurture. This shift transformed not just my production process but my entire career, leading to everything I've accomplished since.<br><br>
            In this 12-week journey, I'll guide you through the same transformation. I'll show you how to collaborate with music as a living force rather than trying to control it. You'll evolve from a technical producer into an empowered artist who creates music that genuinely moves people—starting with yourself.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2;">This course lives in the space between technical mastery and emotional intelligence. While we'll deep-dive into production techniques, our focus remains on developing a personal creative philosophy—one that grounds your decisions in intuition rather than endless comparison or second-guessing.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 2;">It's not just about teaching you production techniques - though you will become a technical master - it's about helping you cultivate a mindset that will support a lifetime of authentic, connected and meaningful artistic expression.</p>
            
            <h5 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 40px; line-height: 1.5;">

                Howdy. I'm TÂCHES - a world-renowned artist and creativity coach. When not working on my own music, I teach producers like yourself how to break free from the shackles of overthinking and become empowered artists capable of authentically expressing yourself and consistently sharing your art with the world.<br><br>
                Over the last 13 years, I've captured the hearts of millions globally with over 116 tracks released on my critically acclaimed label GLITTER COWBOY, as well as many other respected labels like Anjunadeep, Get Physical, Kitsuné and Kindisch.<br><br>
                I've been asked to create official remixes for globally renowned artists, including RÜFÜS DU SOL, ZHU, and Wiz Khalifa. As a performer, I've graced iconic clubs and festivals worldwide, including XOYO (London), Do Not Sit On The Furniture (Miami), Output (New York), Burning Man, Splash House and Bestival. My work has been featured in top publications like Vogue, Billboard, and Mixmag. Additionally, I was a featured artist on British Airways' In-flight Entertainment, with a 2-hour mix of solely original music streaming on flights globally.<br><br>
                I believe that music production need not be just a technical skill but a spiritual practice—an art form that has the power to effect positive change in the world. What sets me apart from other teachers is my holistic approach to education, which seamlessly blends the development of technical mastery with deep intuition, guiding my students to find their unique voices as artists and use them to make a lasting impact on the world.

TÂCHES is hilarious and his ability to relate to his students with funny anecdotes made each lesson a joy. Before this course, I found excuses not to make music because "I wasn't inspired." Now, I feel empowered to create inspiration for myself. I am so thankful for every minute spent with TÂCHES"

I really harmonise with TÂCHES' unique way of connecting with music in an organic, ritualistic kind of way. It was great receiving feedback from TÂCHES but I also really loved getting input from the other students. Being part of a course together and learning as a community is just amazing. It really helped me level up and I'm much more able to enjoy making music and have become much less afraid to share it with others."

            <h2>JOINING HEART OF SOUND</h2>
            <p>This isn't about finding "perfect" producers—it's about creating the right chemistry between what you need and what I can offer. Having taught hundreds of producers, I've learned that this alignment is what leads to transformative results.

                    Tell me about your musical background, current challenges, and aspirations. Include links to your work if you have some—I'm looking for genuine expression and potential, not technical perfection. I personally review every application because I want to understand your unique situation.

We'll talk about your relationship with music, what lights you up creatively, and how Heart of Sound might fit into your journey. My goal is for both of us to feel confident about working together.

If we both feel good about moving forward, I'll share payment options, exact course dates, and some initial reflections to prepare your mind for the transformation ahead.

    <!-- #15 FAQ (1 column, 8 blocks wide) -->
    <section class="faq section-dark">
        <div class="container width-8">
            <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 50px;">QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE</h2>

<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">What equipment do I need?</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">You'll need Ableton Live, a reliable computer, headphones or monitor speakers, and a journal. A MIDI controller is helpful but not essential. The focus of our work together is more on your creative approach than specific gear or plugins.</p>

<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">I'm worried my music isn't "good enough" yet. Should I wait until I improve more?</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hear this concern often, and it's exactly the mindset shift we address in the course. The truth is, your music becomes "good enough" through the process of finishing and releasing it, not before. If you have a solid understanding of your DAW basics and have been producing for at least 6 months, you're ready. This course is about transforming your relationship with music, not achieving some arbitrary technical standard first.</p>

<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">How is this different from all the tutorials and courses available online?</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">Most production education focuses solely on technical knowledge—another plugin, another technique, another shortcut. What's missing is the integration of those skills with your unique creative voice and a sustainable creative practice. Heart of Sound bridges this gap by addressing both the technical and the intuitive, the practical and the philosophical. Plus, you're getting direct access to me and a supportive community, not just passive video content.</p>

<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">What if I miss a lesson?</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">Life happens, and I've designed the course with that in mind. All sessions are recorded and permanently available for you to rewatch. My teaching assistant and I also provide session summaries with key points, so you can quickly catch up even if you miss a live session.</p>

<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">How much time will I need each week?</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">You should plan for 5-10 hours weekly, including 4 hours of live calls plus at least 1-6 hours for assignments. I've found this is the sweet spot that allows for meaningful progress without overwhelming your schedule. The course is designed to integrate with your life, not consume it.</p>

<hr style="border: none; height: 1px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); margin: 30px auto; width: 80%; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">I worry I won't be able to keep up with others in the course. What if I'm behind?</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;">This isn't a competition—it's a personal journey supported by a community. Each producer moves at their own pace, and I welcome and celebrate that diversity. Some of my most successful students initially felt they were "behind," only to discover their unique perspective was exactly what made their music special. I'm there to meet you where you are.</p>
